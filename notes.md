# CS240 Notes

## Java Overview
**Differences from C++**
- References instead of pointers
- Built in garbage collection
- Data types are always the same size in Java

### Fun facts
Java is a compiled language, it uses Byte Code generated by the compiler to then send to the JVM.

Interpreter languages are things like JavaScript and Python

The name of the class has to be named the same as the file.

**How to run a Java File:**
```cmd
java --cp bin/ X arg1 arg2 ...
```

### Coding Examples in java 

```java
public class SimpleJavaClass {
    
    private int x;
    private static boolean b; //static functions can access static variables
    
    public static void main(String[] args){// static means that it's a method of the class itself, NOT attached to an object, standalone function
        System.out.println("Hello from SimpleJavaClass");
    } 
}
```

## Javadoc

JDK documentation from Oracle, available to use on the test!

## Wrappers vs Primitive

Byte and byte

use the Wrapper to be able to manipulate and change between strings, ints, etc.

## Strings

**Strings are objects!**

They are also immutable, meaning they cant be altered, to change a string, you must make
a new one.

```java
String.format("%s %s", s1, s2); 
//%s are placeholders for strings
```

Stringbuilder
```java
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
builder.append("Using ");
//.. the rest of the code
```

## Pointer stuff

```java
public static void main(String[] args){
    Point t1 = new Point (10, 10);
    Point br = new Point (20, 20);
    Rectangle r = new Rectangle(t1, br);
    int w = 5;
    String text = args[0];
    
    boolean ok = drawRectangle(r, w, text);
}


public boolean drawRectangle (Rectangle rect, int width, String label){
    
}
```

## Arrays

Hardcoding the values in:
```java
int [] myArray = {2, 5, 4, 1};
```

string array
```java
Stirng [] myStringArray = {"What", "is", "up"};
```
